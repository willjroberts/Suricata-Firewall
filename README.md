Suricata Firewall is a fun project I made as way to test my understanding of Python by applying what I learned to a 
real world use case. I plan to make improvements to this code as I improve my own programming skills. 

This program is set up to run as a Linux daemon. In practice, it would run on a Linux box on a bridge interface 
monitoring network traffic. The program acts as a firewall by scanning Suricata logs for specified alerts and blocking 
the corresponding IP addresses by adding them to an ipset list. Before running the program, your system needs to 
have ipset installed and an ipset list created. To have your system block the IPs, make sure to add the ipset list 
to iptables.
